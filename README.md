In this study, I tried to predict Breast Cancer using 6 different algorithm:

1)Logistic regression classification
2)SVM (Support Vector Machine) classification
3)Naive bayes classification
4)Decision tree classification
5)Random forest classification
6)K-Nearest Neighbor classification

Predictor variable use in classifying breast cancer, its features are computed for each cell nucleus:

> mean_radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
> mean_texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
> mean_perimeter
> mean_area
> mean_smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)

I measure the study of 7 different algorithms using a confusion matrix.
