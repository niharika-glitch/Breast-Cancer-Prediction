In this study, I tried to predict Breast Cancer using 6 different algorithm:

Logistic regression classification
SVM (Support Vector Machine) classification
Naive bayes classification
Decision tree classification
Random forest classification
K-Nearest Neighbor classification

Predictor variable use in classifying breast cancer, its features are computed for each cell nucleus:

mean_radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
mean_texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
mean_perimeter
mean_area
mean_smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
